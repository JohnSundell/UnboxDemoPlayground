# UnboxDemoPlayground
A Swift Playground that comes setup with Unbox &amp; Wrap, used in my CocoaHeads Stockholm presentation on 2nd of May 2016.

You can use this Playground to try out the Unbox & Wrap APIs without having to add them to any app. It comes setup with 3 JSON files (`A.json`, `B.json` & `C.json`) that contains data for 3 iterations of a `User` model.

## Installing

- Clone the repo.
- Run `$ git submodule update --init` to get Unbox & Wrap.
- Open `UnboxDemo.xcworkspace` that contains both the Playground + Unbox & Wrap.

## Need help?

If you need any help with either Unbox or Wrap, feel free to open an issue in their respective repositories, or tweet at me (@johnsundell).
